The NicheMapR package is an R implementation of a biophysical modelling software originally developed by Warren Porter and colleagues in the 1970s. Biophysical modelling is the application of physical principles of heat, mass and momentum transfer to organisms. 

Porter became interested in this approach to understand a simple question about a lizard, the desert iguana - what is the thermal advantage to it being able to change colour from dark to light? To answer this question, Porter collaborated with mechanical engineers to develop Fortran programs for computing the lizard's heat budget. They also developed a microclimate model of the desert environment to estimate the environmental conditions required by the heat budget. 

These models allowed them to answer the question about colour change in the desert iguana, but also to calculate many other important aspects of the ecology of ectotherms as determined by the physical environment, including water loss, energy requirements, and even potential interactions with prey and predators.

Subsequently, Porter and colleagues developed equivalent heat budget calculations for endotherms (birds and mammals).
